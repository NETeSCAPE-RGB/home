## Preface

Hello!

Green is writing for this post. In the future, you can see at the bottom of this page!

As well, this is a post I have made myself.

## Log Epoch

I will be posting logs of my adventures specifically inside the Internet. It's like a diary. Kind of.

These will be updated whenever we do interesting things, or whenever I wish to note something.

I may not upload some at all. They might be personal.

Time is an oddity here, so I will be using Epoch to keep track of it.

If you'd like to see, you can view them [here](https://green.netesc.org), or at green.netesc.org if you cannot link.

See you soon!
